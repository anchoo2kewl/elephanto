## Executive Summary

This PRD documents comprehensive enhancements to the ElephantTO Events admin panel, focusing on event-specific user preference management, improved UI/UX, and robust event management capabilities. These changes enable administrators to efficiently manage events and user data with full visibility into event-specific preferences and responses.

## 1. Overview & Objectives

### 1.1 Problem Statement

- Event saving functionality had critical bugs
- UI/UX needed improvements for better accessibility and user experience

### 1.2 Success Metrics
- ✅ Event-specific user preference tracking
- ✅ Improved admin workflow efficiency
- ✅ Enhanced data visibility and management
- ✅ Bug-free event creation and editing
- ✅ Better user experience with proper feedback mechanisms

## 2. Feature Specifications

### 2.1 Event-Specific User Preferences

**Requirement:** All user preferences must be tracked per event

**Implementation:**
- Database schema updated with `event_id` foreign keys
- Backend services filter preferences by active event
- Admin panel displays event names instead of UUIDs
- Historical preference data maintained per event

**User Stories:**
- As an admin, I can view user preferences for specific events
- As an admin, I can see which event a user's preferences belong to
- As a system, I maintain separate preference records for each event

### 2.2 Enhanced Admin User Management

**Requirement:** Comprehensive user profile editing with full preference visibility

**Implementation:**
- Unified user edit modal with all profile data
- Survey details displayed as radio buttons with proper labels
- Cocktail preferences shown as radio buttons with emojis
- Event information clearly displayed for each preference set

**User Stories:**
- As an admin, I can edit all user details in one interface
- As an admin, I can see user survey responses in a readable format
- As an admin, I can view cocktail preferences with visual indicators

### 2.3 Improved Event Management

**Requirement:** Robust event creation, editing, and management system

**Implementation:**
- Fixed event save functionality with proper error handling
- Success/error notifications with auto-hide
- Loading states during save operations
- Event activation and status management

**User Stories:**
- As an admin, I can create and edit events without errors
- As an admin, I receive clear feedback when saving events
- As an admin, I can manage event status and activation

### 2.4 Enhanced UI/UX

**Requirement:** Improved accessibility and user experience

**Implementation:**
- ESC key support for closing all dialogs
- Consistent glass-morphism design language
- Clear visual feedback and notifications
- Responsive modal layouts

**User Stories:**
- As a user, I can press ESC to close any dialog
- As a user, I receive visual feedback for all actions
- As a user, I have a consistent and pleasant interface experience

## 3. Technical Implementation

### 3.1 Database Changes

**Schema Updates:**
```sql
-- Added event_id to user preference tables
ALTER TABLE survey_responses ADD COLUMN event_id UUID REFERENCES events(id);
ALTER TABLE cocktail_preferences ADD COLUMN event_id UUID REFERENCES events(id);

-- Fixed database trigger function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_updated_at_column()
RETURNS trigger AS $$
BEGIN
    NEW.updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

**Data Migration:**
- Existing user preferences linked to active event
- Maintained data integrity during migration

### 3.2 Backend Services

**Enhanced Services:**
- `CocktailPreferenceService`: Event-aware preference management
- `SurveyResponseService`: Event-specific response handling
- `AdminHandler`: Enhanced user details with event information

**API Improvements:**
- Event name included in user preference responses
- Proper request validation and error handling
- Fixed SQL query construction in event updates

### 3.3 Frontend Components

**New Components:**
- `useEscapeKey` hook for keyboard accessibility
- Shared survey constants for consistency
- Enhanced notification system

**Enhanced Components:**
- `Admin.tsx`: Comprehensive user and event management
- Event modals with proper state management
- User edit interfaces with improved data display

### 3.4 Shared Constants

**Created `/frontend/src/constants/survey.ts`:**
- Centralized survey options and labels
- Cocktail preferences with emojis and descriptions
- Prevents duplication and ensures consistency

## 4. User Experience Improvements

### 4.1 Admin Workflow Enhancements

**Before:**
- Raw database field names in survey display
- Text inputs for all preference fields
- No event context for user preferences
- Error-prone event saving

**After:**
- Human-readable labels for all survey fields
- Radio buttons with all options visible
- Clear event context for all preferences
- Reliable event saving with feedback

### 4.2 Accessibility Improvements

**Keyboard Navigation:**
- ESC key closes all dialogs consistently
- Proper focus management in modals

**Visual Feedback:**
- Loading states during operations
- Success/error notifications with auto-hide
- Clear visual hierarchy and organization
